Solution. Yes. If the subarrays are in sorted order, then the inplace merge produces proper output. If one subarray is
not in sorted order, then its entries will appear in the output in the same order that they appear in the input (with
entries from the other subarray intermixed).
CounterExample:
array1= [0,1,2,3]
array2= [7,6,5,4]
the result of merge is [0,1,2,3,7,6,5,4]
