Because insertion sort uses N-1 compares and 0 exchange when in best case, and the best case uses N(N-1)/2 compares and
N(N-1)/2 exchanges.
When sorting on a random ordered array where elements have only one of three values, the running time is still quadratic,
but it should be shorter than when sorting on a normal array.
